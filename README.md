# Mission-To-Mars-
Module 10 Challenge 
Summary: 
In this challenge we focused on web scraping and finding our own data from the website and then using it to plug into our tools such as Python, 
Jupyter NotebookHTML, Beautifulsoup, Flask Web, and Mongo Database. 
Mission To Mars is gathering all the diffrent data to find out about this red plant. Most websites only know so much about a specific subjest and the people that 
are reserching or plugging in all the data often times have to look for external resources to research more detail of their subject line. 
For the planet Mars Scientist and Astronauts know so much knowledge because of the different data that has scraped, analyized, published and posted from diffrent companies 
in the past serveal decades. Scraping the web from Newas titles, papragraphs and images is what infromation will be in a database from there you can use these tools
to then be able to identify and research the subject in which you are trying to learn about for this Challenge We learned all about planet Mars and what it would take to get there.
